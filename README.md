<h1>OCR img to tXt</h1>

<h3>using tesseract.js hosted on node.js backend with express framework </h3>
<p>Ejs for templating frontend , where in tesseract oem (OCR engine Mode ) is custom set to 3 (this was set while testing the images of codes) </p>
One can always change mode ie: oem and psm as per their requirement  , more oem means higher possibility of reading complex data .
